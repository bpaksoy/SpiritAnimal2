    <h3>Nature of Sea Turtles</h3>
    <img src="https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2014/12/hawksbill-sea-turtle.jpg">
    <p>Sea turtles are reptiles. Though they are adapted to life in the marine environment, sea turtles breathe air. They have powerful flippers instead of legs and cannot retract their bodies into their shells like land tortoises. Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the ocean, but adult females do return to the beach to lay their eggs. Females nest every two or three years and lay several nests during one season. Nests are, on average, about 100 eggs. The eggs incubate in the sand for approximately 60 days, depending on the species. Hatchlings emerge from the nests at night as a group and hurry down the beach to the ocean. </p>
